# JAVA-Python-Crypto-Marriage
Recently, I encountered the AES encryption algorithm in conjunction with the java project. The java code has SecureRandom.getInstance("SHA1PRNG"); Python can't find the corresponding method. This repo tries to solve the issue

C#, php, js code is found in various ways, everyone has encountered and solved Not much, C# directly use java to calculate the key, and then use C# to calculate AES ( https://blog.csdn.net/yunhua_lee/article/details/17226089 ), which takes about 2 days, and finally finds the method in the PHP code. ( https://github.com/myGGT/crypt_aes/blob/master/crypt_aes.php ), the relevant JavaScript code ( https://github.com/bombworm/SHA1PRNG/blob/master/index.js ), recorded for Everyone uses it.
